- Encourages independent thinking
- Uses AI as a **learning assistant**, not a decision engine

## 🧠 Philosophy

Many research platforms overwhelm users with conclusions.  
**stockFA focuses on information, not opinions.**

Over time, investors naturally develop a personal set of trusted research tools.  
stockFA aims to be one of those tools — especially for learners and long-term thinkers.
